This means I wont call you `divya garu` again
This means I'll forget we are getting married until the day before,when you remind me
This means I might ocassionally infuriate, disappoint or surprise you
This means I might exhaust all the ways of telling I like you, until you are little annoyed, and still do so
This means I might do things that my older self would cringe and laugh - like writing this
This means I considering the possibility of really opening up to someone
Are you sure ? I am a bit crazy too.
